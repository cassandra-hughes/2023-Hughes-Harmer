# 2023-Hughes-Harmer
Code used in [2023 Hughes and Harmer](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pld3.533) manuscript figures. 

Each figure has its own .Rmd file that includes the code used for analysis and visualization. For some figures, Affinity Designer was used later to combine panels generated in R.
